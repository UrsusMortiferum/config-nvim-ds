# config-nvim-ds

### Introduction

Let's start with reasons for existence of this repo:

* After too much time with VSC - I thought I needed a change; Long story short - I ended up refreshing memory in terms of vim-motions
* Besides working config - goal is to have multi-file clear and well documented config
* Focus on the Data-related activities - Python (output similar to JupyterLab) + DB-related activities #SQL
